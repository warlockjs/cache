# Cache drivers — pick the right one

Seven production drivers + a mock driver ship in-box. Pick by durability, scope, and workload.

| Driver | Process scope | Persists on restart | Good for | Avoid when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `null` | — | — | Disabling cache in tests; feature-flagging off | You actually want caching |
| `memory` | Single process | No | Hot in-process data with default TTL; smallest latency | Multi-process / multi-node |
| `memoryExtended` | Single process | No | Sliding-window TTL (TTL resets on every read) | Any multi-process deploy |
| `lru` | Single process | No | Bounded in-memory caches (capacity-based eviction) | Need cross-process sharing |
| `file` | Single host | Yes | Build artefacts, local dev persistence across restarts | Concurrency (no locks); multi-host |
| `redis` | Shared | Yes (Redis-managed) | Anything shared across processes / nodes | Single-process-only workload — overkill |
| `pg` | Shared | Yes (Postgres-managed) | You already run Postgres; semantic caching / RAG via pgvector | High-throughput hot reads (Redis is faster) |

## Capability matrix

## Global config TTL — accepts number or string

```ts
options: {
  redis:  { url: "...", ttl: "7d" },   // string OK
  memory: { ttl: 3600 },                // number OK
  lru:    { capacity: 10_000 },         // LRU has no TTL option today
  file:   { directory: () => "/var/cache/myapp", ttl: "1h" },
  pg:     { client: pool, ttl: "1h" },                           // KV-only
  // pg with pgvector:
  // pg:  { client: pool, vector: { dimensions: 1536, index: "hnsw" } },
}
```

## Global prefix (multi-tenant scoping)

Every driver accepts `globalPrefix: string | (() => string)`. The function form runs per call — pair it with request-local async context to scope every cached key to the current tenant / user / client automatically:

```ts
options: {
  redis: {
    url: "...",
    globalPrefix: () => `tenant-${currentContext.tenantId}`,
  },
}
```

## Key & namespace safety (file / redis)

Cache keys can carry untrusted input (e.g. a `cached()` auto-key derived from a request param), so every built-in driver treats a key as data, never as a path or a query fragment:

- **`file`** — a key/namespace maps to exactly one on-disk directory component: `%`, `/`, and `\` are percent-encoded before the path is built, so `../../etc` becomes an inert directory name instead of a traversal. The resolved path is also asserted to stay inside the configured cache root (throws `CacheError` otherwise) — a second, encoding-independent check. `removeNamespace` clears both the namespace's own directory and every dotted child (`ns`, `ns.*`), honoring `globalPrefix`.
- **`redis`** — `removeNamespace` escapes glob metacharacters (`*`, `?`, `[`, `\`) in the namespace before building its match pattern, and walks matches with a `SCAN` cursor (`scanIterator`) instead of the blocking `KEYS` command, so clearing a namespace on a large keyspace doesn't stall the event loop for other tenants.
- **Errors that echo a connection string** (Redis `connect()` failures, any driver's failed op) are logged through a `safeErrorInfo()` helper that redacts `scheme://user:pass@` credentials to `scheme://[REDACTED]@` and never prints the raw `Error` object — see [`@warlock.js/cache/handle-cache-errors/SKILL.md`](@warlock.js/cache/handle-cache-errors/SKILL.md).

## Registering a custom driver

```ts
import { BaseCacheDriver, cache } from "@warlock.js/cache";

class MemcachedCacheDriver extends BaseCacheDriver<MyClient, MyOptions> {
  public name = "memcached";
  // … implement set / get / remove / flush / removeNamespace / connect
}

cache.setCacheConfigurations({
  default: "memcached",
  drivers: { memcached: MemcachedCacheDriver },
  options: { memcached: { host: "localhost" } },
});
```

Extending `BaseCacheDriver` gives you free: TTL parsing, key parsing, event emission, stampede-safe `remember`, deep-clone-on-read, default `update` / `merge` / `list` implementations.

## Runtime driver options — `cache.use(name, options)`

Some driver options can only be built at runtime (`pg`'s `client: pg.Pool`, pre-wired clients). Pass them as the second arg to `cache.use` / `cache.load` / `cache.driver` — they merge over `setCacheConfigurations({ options })` per-key, runtime wins.

```ts
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });

cache.setCacheConfigurations({
  default: "pg",
  drivers: { pg: PgCacheDriver },
  options: { pg: { table: "cache" } },        // static
});

await cache.use("pg", { client: pool });       // runtime — skip init() in this case
```

Constraints:
- The driver name must be registered in `setCacheConfigurations({ drivers })` — runtime options don't bypass registration.
- Once a driver is loaded, calling `use`/`load`/`driver` again with **non-empty** new options throws `CacheConfigurationError`. Register a second driver name if you need a different config.
- Calling without options (or with `{}`) on an already-loaded driver returns the cached instance silently.

## Per-call driver override

When most writes go to the default driver but one call needs a different one:

```ts
await cache.set("audit:event", event, { driver: "redis" });
```

The manager loads (and connects) the override driver lazily on first use, then routes that single operation through it without mutating `currentDriver`.
